# City Boundary Shapefiles

Shapefiles for each city on file should be downloaded for drawing the city scale 
map, when the user is zooming into a speciic city. I dowloaded this data from 
[Cencus Bureau](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/cartographic-boundary.html)
